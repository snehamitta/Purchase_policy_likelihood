# Predict purchase likelihood 

A crack at Allstate Purchase Prediction Challenge put up on Kaggle. The nominal predictors are:

1.	group_size: How many people will be covered under the policy (1, 2, 3 or 4)?
2.	homeowner: Whether the customer owns a home or not (0=no, 1=yes)
3.	married_couple: Does the customer group contain a married couple (0=no, 1=yes)


 Will be using a Multinomial Locistic Model to predict purchase likelihood of coverage using three predictors.

 Will also be testing out using Naive Bayes Method on the same dataset.
